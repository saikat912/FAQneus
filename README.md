# FAQenius

## Description
FAQenius is an intelligent, FAQ-based chatbot designed to provide instant, automated responses to frequently asked questions. Built with Python, it leverages few-shot learning, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to deliver accurate answers—even with small datasets. FAQenius is ideal for businesses seeking 24/7 customer support without human intervention.

## Problem Statement

FAQenius addresses these challenges by using few-shot learning techniques, enabling robust intent classification and relevant answers even from minimal data.
